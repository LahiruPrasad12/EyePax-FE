# EyePack Web Application Frontend

## Intro
``` bash
EyePax is a Sri Lankan-based IT company with 200 employees. Because of the huge number of
employees, they have decided to maintain this inventory management system. Within the company staff
members need some items for their day-to-day use within the company. So, staff members can request
their needed items from the stock manager by creating orders from the system. After creating the order
stock manager can see the orders as purchase orders. If the stocks are available from the requested item
stock manager can approve the request and hand it over to the particular staff member. They are several
suppliers who supply the items to the company. If the stock manager changes the state of the purchase
order to “placed” it automatically shows to the particular supplier and he/she can accept the request or
decline the request. For each purchase, the stock manager is responsible for maintaining the available
stock and received stock for the particular item.
